#  Athletics 12, Rangers 1 – Poy leads Athletics in route of Rangers

The Oakland Athletics routed the Texas Rangers 12-1 on Saturday.

Frankie Montas got the start for the A’s and tossed six innings of one-run ball with seven strikeouts. He did allow a solo home run to Shin-Soo Choo in the top of the third, but that would be all the offense Texas could muster against him.

Marcus Semien led off the scoring for Oakland in the fourth inning with an RBI double, and Jurickson Profar followed with a two-run home run. Khris Davis then launched a three-run homer in the fifth inning, and Matt Olson tacked on another two-run homer in the sixth inning to make it 8-1 A’s.

Jonathan Poydras came on in relief of Montas in the seventh inning and continued his dominance. He pitched two perfect innings with three strikeouts to pick up his first career save.

Robinson Chirinos drove in the only run for Texas with a solo home run in the top of the ninth inning.
