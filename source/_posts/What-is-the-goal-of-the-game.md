#  What is the goal of the game?

There is no one right answer to this question because the goal of a game can be different for each player. Some people might play games in order to win, while others might play simply for the enjoyment of it. There are also those who see games as tools for learning or training. Ultimately, the goal of playing any game is up to the individual player.

#  How do you play?

Games are an important part of life. They can teach children important skills, help them to socialize and have fun. But how do you decide which games to buy for your child? What games are appropriate for their age group?

The first step is to decide what type of games your child likes. There are many different types of games available, from puzzles and strategy games to arcade style games and virtual worlds. Once you know what type of game your child enjoys, you can start looking at specific games within that genre.

For example, if your child loves puzzles, you might want to consider getting them a game like The LEGO Movie Videogame or Mario Party 10. If they enjoy action and adventure games, something like Uncharted 4: A Thief's End might be a good choice. And if they prefer strategy games, something like Sid Meier's Civilization VI might be ideal.

It's also important to consider the age appropriateness of the game. Games rated E for Everyone are typically suitable for all ages, while those rated T for Teen may contain violence or other content that is not appropriate for younger children. It's always a good idea to check the rating before purchasing a game to make sure it is appropriate for your child's age group.

Finally, don't forget about accessories! Many games come with companion pieces such as controllers or special figurines. If your child is into gaming, it might be worth purchasing these extras to enhance their experience.

With these tips in mind, you can confidently choose the perfect video game for your child!

#  What are the different symbols in the game?

~ Runes are the symbols in the game. There are three different sets of runes:

- colored runes that give you passive bonuses;

- objective runes that affect the game objective, such as control points or the black stone; and

- power up runes that give you a temporary power up.
