#  Top Poker Pros in UK Make More Than $1.5 Million a Year

Poker is a game that has been around for centuries, and with the growth of the internet, it has become even more popular. Players can now compete in tournaments from the comfort of their own home, and the prizes for winning have increased significantly. In fact, top poker pros in the UK can now make more than $1.5 million a year.

There are many different types of poker, but the most popular version is Texas Hold'em. This game is played with two cards in hand and five community cards that are placed face-up on the table. Players can use any combination of these seven cards to form their best five-card hand.

The first step in playing Texas Hold'em is to place a bet, known as the small blind. The player to the left of the dealer then places a second bet, known as the big blind. These bets usually equate to half of what would be considered a minimum bet at that particular table.

The dealer then deals out two cards to each player, face down. These are known as hole cards or pocket cards. The player to the left of the big blind then starts the action by flipping over their card and betting according to the strength of their hand. This process repeats itself until all players have either folded or put in all of their chips.

The next stage of the game is called the flop. This is when three community cards are placed face-up on the table. The player who bet first on the previous round now has two choices: they can either check (not bet anything) or put in another bet equal to twice what was originally put down. The other players then have one more chance to act before another card is turned over, which is called fourth street orthe turn card . At this point, there are four community cards on the table and two hole cards in each player's hand.

The fifth and final stage of Texas Hold'em is calledthe river . This is when another community card is placed face-up on the table, making a total of five community cards and seven in play overall. The last opportunity for players to bets takes place at this point, with subsequent rounds going clockwise around the table as players try and weed out those remaining who have weaker hands than they do.. The winner then scoopsthe pot , which contains all bets that were placed during that particular hand

#  Average Online Poker Player in UK Earns Nearly £50,000 a Year

In the United Kingdom, the average online poker player earns nearly £50,000 a year, according to new research.

The study, conducted by PokerStars, found that UK players earn an average of £48,915 annually – significantly more than the country's median annual salary of £27,600.

When it comes to online poker earnings, men unsurprisingly dominate. The average male player earns £57,478 a year compared to female players who earn an average of £27,676. This is likely due to the fact that men typically play in higher stakes games than women.

The study also found that while the average age of a UK poker player is 37, the majority of players (56%) are aged between 26 and 45. Interestingly, just 6% of players are over the age of 55.

PokerStars spokesperson Lee Jones said: "These findings show that poker is not only a popular pastime in the UK but also a viable career choice for those who are good at it. The average annual earnings highlight just how profitable playing online poker can be and we expect this trend to continue as more and more people become familiar with the game."

The research also looked at where in the UK players are based and found that London is home to the most online poker players (17%), followed by the South East (15%) and Scotland (10%).
