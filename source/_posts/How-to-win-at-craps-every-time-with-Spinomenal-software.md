#  How to win at craps every time with Spinomenal software

Craps is a game of chance where you can make money if you know how to play it right. There are different ways to bet, and the best way to win at craps is by using Spinomenal software.

The first step is to understand the different types of bets. There are six main bets in craps, and each one has a different payout:

1. Pass line - this is the most common bet, and it pays even money. You win if the shooter rolls a 7 or 11, and you lose if the shooter rolls a 2, 3, or 12.

2. Come - this is also a common bet, and it pays even money like the pass line bet. However, you can only make this bet after the come out roll. You win if the shooter rolls a 7 or 11, and you lose if the shooter rolls a 2, 3, or 12.

3. Don't pass line - this is the opposite of the pass line bet, and it pays even money as well. You win if the shooter rolls a 2 or 3, and you lose if the shooter rolls a 7 or 11.

4. Odds - this bet pays out depending on what number is rolled. For example, if you bet on an odds bet for a 4 and 6, then you would get paid 2:1 when either of those numbers are rolled.

5. Come odds - this is similar to an odds bet, but it's for the come out roll instead of any other number. For example, if you put down a come odds bet for a 4 and 6 on the come out roll, then you would get paid 2:1 when either of those numbers are rolled again later in the game.

6. Place bets - these are bets that are placed on certain numbers instead of betting against other numbers. There are different place bets depending on what number you want to place your bet on: 4th street (5), 5th street (6), 6th street (8), 8th street (9), 9th street (10), 10th street (11), and 11th street (12). Each one of these place bets pays out at different odds depending on what number is rolled: 4th street (7:1), 5th street (9:1), 6th street (15:1), 8th street (30:1), 9th street (35:1), 10th street (40:1), 11th street (45:1), 12th street (50:1).

#  How Spinomenal's craps game offers players the best odds

 Craps is a popular dice game in gambling casinos. The game is easy to learn and offers players some of the best odds in the casino. At Spinomenal, we have recreated this classic dice game for online casino players.

Craps is played with two dice where you bet on different combinations of numbers. Players can place bets on the pass line or the don't pass line. The object of the game is to roll a seven or eleven on the first roll, which are known as a natural, or to roll a two, three or twelve which are known as craps. If another number is rolled, that becomes the point and players can either bet on the point again or take odds against it happening again.

The house edge in craps is 1.41%. This means that for every $100 bet, the house only wins $1.41 in the long run. This is much lower than most other casino games and is one of the reasons why craps is so popular.

At Spinomenal, we offer players a choice of four different craps games to enjoy. These include Classic Craps, 3D Craps, Multi-Player Craps and Vegas Craps. All of our craps games offer excellent graphics and realistic gameplay for an authentic casino experience.
