#  Who created Vanitify and why?

The founder of Vanitify is Curtis Fry. A young entrepreneur who had a passion for both fashion and technology, he saw an opportunity to merge the two industries with the advent of online shopping. In 2009, when he founded the company, there were few online stores that catered to fashionable men. He set out to change that by creating a platform that would make it easy for men to find stylish clothes and accessories online.

Today, Vanitify is one of the leading online retailers for men’s fashion, and Curtis remains committed to making the shopping experience as easy and enjoyable as possible. With a team of dedicated employees, Vanitify continues to grow and bring the latest in men’s fashion to its customers.
