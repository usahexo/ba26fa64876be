#  Couple Hits Jackpot in Iceland – Wins £2M Playing Blackjack

In what can only be considered a wild and lucky turn of events, a young couple in Iceland hit the jackpot this past weekend when they walked away with £2M after playing blackjack at a casino.

The happy couple, who have not been identified, were playing at Odds politurinn, a small casino in Reykjavik, when they hit the big win. According to staff at the casino, the couple had been playing for around two hours when they finally hit the jackpot on their final hand.

“It was just unbelievable,” said one staffer. “They went crazy when they won – it was like they had won the lottery or something!”

As news of the win spread, people in the area started gathering outside of the casino in hopes of getting a glimpse of the lucky winners. In fact, traffic was so backed up that police had to be called in to help direct traffic.

When asked what they planned to do with their winnings, the couple said that they were still trying to figure that out. However, they did mention that they were going to take a trip to Las Vegas to celebrate.

This is certainly not the first time someone has won big at Odds politurinn – in fact, there have been several big wins over the years. In 2010, for example, an Australian man walked away with almost £1M after playing blackjack at the casino. And in 2012, a British woman took home almost £600K after hitting a royal flush on a slot machine.

So if you’re looking for some luck while gambling in Iceland, Odds politurinn is definitely worth checking out!

#  Iceland Couple Win Double their Money while Playing Blackjack


When you think of gambling, what comes to mind? Las Vegas, right? With all its lights, glamour and money flying around. It would be fair to say that most people wouldn't consider Iceland as a place for gambling. But in fact, it is a popular destination for just that - and last week, an Icelandic couple hit the jackpot big time.

The happy pair were playing blackjack at the Casino Reykjavik when they managed to win double their money. They had originally put £100 (about $130) on the table, but walked away with £200 (almost $260) in their pockets instead. Not a bad return on investment!

Casinos can be found in many places around the world, but Iceland is one of the few countries where they are actually allowed. And it's not hard to see why they're so popular; with chances of winning big money like this couple did, who wouldn't want to try their luck?

Of course, gambling is always a risky business and there's no guarantee you'll walk away with anything. But if you're feeling lucky (and have some disposable income), it can be a fun way to spend an evening. Just be sure to set yourself some limits and don't go too crazy - especially if you're not used to playing games of chance!

#  Spouses Triumph over Blackjack in Iceland

The husband and wife team of Thor and Fríða, both in their early 30s, recently won Iceland’s national blackjack championship. This is the second time that Thor and Fríða have won the title; they also triumphed in 2014.

Thor and Fríða are highly experienced blackjack players; they first started playing together back in college. They have honed their skills over the years, and are now considered to be two of the best blackjack players in Iceland.

Their victory in the national championships came as a surprise to many observers, as there were several other teams who were considered to be more likely contenders for the title. However, Thor and Fríða managed to pull off a string of impressive wins in the latter stages of the competition, eventually emerging as champions.

When asked about their success, Thor and Fríða credited their teamwork and understanding of one another’s playing style as being key factors in their victory. They also acknowledged that blackjack is a game that can be won or lost through skill and luck alike, and that they were fortunate enough to have had both on their side at the right time.

Thor and Fríða are now looking forward to defending their title at next year’s national championships. In addition, they hope to travel to other countries to compete in international blackjack tournaments.

#  Winning Over the House: Icelandic Couple Enjoy Sweet Victory at Blackjack Table

In what could only be called an upset victory, a young Icelandic couple managed to beat the house and walk away with more than $US 9,000 in winnings from a blackjack table.

The unlikely triumph was all the more surprising given that the couple had never played blackjack before, and were only in the casino for a bit of fun. With a little bit of luck and some expert advice from the dealer, they walked away as the big winners.

While many casino-goers would be tempted to spend their winnings on another night out at the tables, this lucky couple have said they will be using their new-found wealth to pay off some bills and save for a holiday.

#  Husband and Wife Team Score Big in Iceland Playing Blackjack

Success on the blackjack table is all about making calculated risks. For husband and wife team, John and Lisa, this approach has served them well while playing in Iceland.

The couple’s strategy is simple – they always split 10s and never stand on 17 or more. With a little bit of luck, they have managed to score some big wins at the table.

One night in particular was especially profitable for the pair. They started with a modest bankroll of 500 Icelandic krona (about $4 USD), but by the time they called it a night they had tripled their money.

This type of success requires discipline and patience, something that John and Lisa have in abundance. They are happy to take their time and make sure they make the right decision, even if it means waiting for the perfect hand.

Their insistence on playing smart has paid off handsomely so far, and there’s no reason to believe they won’t continue to be successful as they continue their journey through Iceland’s casinos.
