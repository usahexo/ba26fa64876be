#  Roulette JungleRaja announces reunion tour!

It was one the biggest reunion tours of all time. Raja and his jungle friends had not been seen together on stage in over 25 years and the excitement was palpable. Tickets sold out within minutes and anticipation was high as the day of the show drew nearer.

For many of the fans in attendance, it was a chance to relive their childhood, when they first fell in love with Raja and his animal friends. They laughed and sang along to all of the old classics like “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” and “In The Jungle”.

There were a few new songs in the setlist as well, but most of the show consisted of remixed versions of the old favourites. The crowd went wild when Raja finally appeared, dressed in his signature loincloth and headband. He looked as fit and agile as ever, jumping around on stage and interacting with his adoring fans.

It was an incredible show, made even more special by the fact that it was a reunion tour. There are few things in life that are more satisfying than seeing your childhood heroes onstage once again, performing all of your favourite songs. Bravo, Raja!

#  Unreleased album to be released after 30 years!

On September 7th, 2018, an unreleased album recorded by John Lennon and Yoko Ono was announced. The album, titled "Unfinished Music No.2: Life with the Lions", will be released in November of this year, 50 years after it was first recorded!

The album was originally recorded between May and October of 1968 at their home in the Dakota building in New York City. It was said to be heavily influenced by their avant-garde performance art pieces at the time. Only a few copies were ever made, and they were only given to friends and family.

This will be the first time that the album has been released to the public. Many of the songs on the album have never been heard before! In an interview, Ono described the album as "very noisy... It's like a lion." She also said that it was "a kind of diary of our life at that time."

This is sure to be an exciting release for Beatles fans! It's a rare opportunity to hear some of Lennon and Ono's earliest work together.

#  New documentary sheds light on the mysterious band!

_The Residents_, a band shrouded in mystery and anonymity, has long been a fascination for music fans around the world. Who are these masked musicians, and what do their songs mean?

Now, a new documentary is shedding light on the enigmatic group. The film includes interviews with past and present members of the band, as well as rare footage of their live performances.

According to those interviewed in the film, the Residents have always been about experimentation and pushing boundaries. They've never been interested in making conventional pop music. Instead, they've channeled their energies into creating strange and often darkly humorous songs that defy easy description.

The documentary also explores the Residents' obsession with masks. They've always worn masks on stage, partly because they want to create a sense of mystery and intrigue, but also because they feel it helps them to create new characters and identities.

Even after more than 40 years together, the Residents remain an enigma. But this new documentary provides some much-needed insight into one of the most unique and enigmatic bands in history.
