If you're new to roulette, don't worry – there's no need to feel intimidated. This article will teach you everything you need to know about playing this popular casino game. We'll start with the basics and then move on to more advanced topics. So let's get started!

# The Basics

Roulette is a casino game that involves betting on numbers or colors. The object of the game is to guess which number or color will come up on the wheel when the ball lands. You can bet on a single number, or you can bet on a range of numbers or colors.

The house edge in roulette is relatively high, so it's important to make smart decisions when placing your bets. In most cases, it's wise to spread your bets out over as many different options as possible. This will minimize your losses if you happen to lose a bet.

# The Roulette Wheel

The roulette wheel has 36 slots numbered 0-36. There are 18 red slots and 18 black slots, plus a green slot for zero. The wheel also has two green slots marked 00.

When placing a bet, you can choose any number from 0-36, or any color from red or black. You can also bet on whether the next spin will result in a number ending in a certain digit (for example, betting on 5 means that you're betting that the next number will be either 5 or 15). There are all sorts of different bets that you can make in roulette – we'll cover them later in this article.

# The Croupier & Betting System

The croupier is responsible for spinning the wheel and dropping the ball into its track. He also deals out cards for blackjack and oversees other games at the table. When it comes to roulette, his job is simply to ensure that all bets are placed correctly and that players follow the rules of the game.

In most casinos, players are not allowed to touch chips until it is their turn at bat . At some casinos (especially online), players are allowed to place chips directly on individual numbers on the betting layout . In this case, once a player has made his bet he slides his chips onto "the layout" in front of him , preferably pointing towards his chosen spot . If he wants change back from a chip worth $5 he would say "give me four", meaning four $1 chips . If instead he wanted two other players each got one $1 chip then he would say "two guys". When giving money away - especially larger denominations - never use hand gestures which might be construed during play . Just put out your open palm and say "here" . Most croupiers will oblige by taking however many chips they think appropriate and holding them until called for again . 

Bets may also be placed verbally , although this sometimes results in mistakes when too many people are shouting out orders simultaneously . In general , anything said clearly and slowly enough will usually be accepted by croupiers , who have learned how to decipher various regional accents ! 

When playing European Roulette - which has only one zero - most casinos allow inside/outside even money bets . These include betting on any red number (18), black number (18), odds (19-36) or evens (2-12) . A chip placed squarely in th middle of two neighbouring squares is also regarded as an even money bet ; eg placing chips halfway between 26 and 27 = an even money bet on either black or red ! 

In American Roulette - which features both zeroes - outside bets become slightly more complicated because now there are 2x chances that an odd number pops up rather than 1x chance when playing European Roulette . These include black/red (even money), Odd/Even (even money), 1-18/19-36 (2:1), Columns/Dozens (2:1)
