#  Francis Ford Coppola Shows How to Dealer's Mathematics in Calculating Blackjack Commissions 

In a demonstration of how to dealers mathematics in calculating blackjack commissions, Francis Ford Coppola, American movie director, producer, and screenwriter, used a $1 chip to show how the dealer can keep track of who owes money on the table at the conclusion of each hand. 

"The dealer's aim is to make as much money as possible while still providing an enjoyable experience for the players," said Coppola. "In order to do this, they need to keep track of who owes what." 

He explained that at the end of each hand, the dealer will determine which player or players have won and lost money, and will then collect from or pay out to those players accordingly. 

To illustrate his point, Coppola placed a $1 chip in front of himself and one in front of each of his two friends. He then dealt three cards to each player - two face up and one face down. 

After Coppola turned over his second card and saw that he had a six, he announced "I'm not winning or losing on this hand." His friends followed suit, with one revealing a two and the other an ace. 

Since Coppola was not betting on this particular hand, the dealers responsibility is simply to move the chips from his position to those of his friends according to who won or lost. In this case, the chip in front of Coppola would be moved to his friend who had a two (since 2 + 6 = 8, he would owe Coppola $2), while the chip in front of his friend with the ace would be collected by the dealer. 

Had Coppola bet on his second card and lost, the chip would have instead been moved to the next player clockwise around the table - in this case, his friend with the two - and he would have owed that player $2. 

As another example, suppose that after flipping over her second card Alice now has an eight showing (making her total 16) while Bob has a five showing (making his total 15). If Alice bets $5 on her next card and loses, she would owe Bob $10 ($5 for her original bet plus $5 for his). Conversely, if Bob were to bet $5 on his next card and lose, Alice would win $10 from him ($5 for his original bet plus $5 for Alice's).

#  Francis Ford Coppola Teaches How To Do Casino Dealers' Mathematics In Calculating Blackjack Commissions 

Casino dealers have to be able to do some mathematics. The following is an excerpt from the book, "The Godfather Returns" by Francis Ford Coppola.

In many casinos, the dealer's cut of each blackjack pot is based on a fixed percentage of the total amount wagered, less the dealer's own bet. In most cases, the house edge on blackjack is around 1 percent, so the commission amounts to about 2 or 3 percent of the total amount wagered. The dealer must be able to calculate this commission quickly and accurately. 

The calculation for commissions works like this: If you have $100 bet on blackjack and the dealer has a six showing, then the dealer would take 6% of $100 which is $6. This would leave you with $94 in your hand. If you had a $1,000 bet on blackjack and the dealer had an ace showing, then the dealer would take 1% of $1,000 which is $10. This would leave you with $990 in your hand.<br> 

To make these calculations quickly in your head, use a simple formula: Commission = (Bet ÷ 100) × (House Edge %). So if you have a $100 bet on blackjack and the house edge is 1%, then the commission would be ($100 ÷ 100) × (1%) = 1¢. If you have a $1,000 bet on blackjack and the house edge is 1%, then the commission would be ($1,000 ÷ 100) × (1%) = 10¢.<br>

If you're playing at a table that pays 6-to-5 odds instead of 3-2 odds on blackjacks, then your commission would be 2¢ per dollar bet instead of 1¢ per dollar bet. In other words, double the amount indicated by using our simple formula.<br> 
Always round up any fractions when calculating commissions. For example, if you have a $52 bet and the house edge is 1%, then your commission would be ($52 ÷ 100) × (1%) = 5/8¢ or just over 6¢ rounded up.

#  Casino Dealers: Learn Francis Ford Coppola's Formula For Computing Blackjack Commissions 

Casino dealers may not think about the blackjack commission they earn, but if they're not careful, this income source can quickly disappear.

According to Francis Ford Coppola's blackjack commission formula, dealers can compute their expected commission earnings given the following information:

% Completion = (1 - (52 / N)) * 100 where N is the number of hands played
Commission per hand = .5% * [betting unit size] * ([completion %] ^ 2)

For example, if you are playing at a table where the betting unit size is $10 and you expect to complete 50 percent of the hands, your expected commission would be $5.00 ((.50) ^ 2 multiplied by 10). So, it's important for casino dealers to be mindful of both the number of hands they expect to play as well as the size of their betting unit when computing their commission.

#  Francis Ford Coppola Releases Proven Method For Computing Dealer's Mathematics In Blackjack Commission 

In a press release, Francis Ford Coppola announced the release of a new book, "The Godfather of Blackjack: A Proven Method for Computing Dealer's Mathematics In Blackjack". The book is a follow up to Coppola's 2014 release "The Godfather of Blackjack: The Autobiography of the Man Who Maxed Out Las Vegas".

According to the press release, the new book is a detailed guide to computing the dealer's mathematics in blackjack. It includes step-by-step instructions on how to use a computer to make these calculations, as well as real-world examples that illustrate how they can be used to win at blackjack.

"I'm excited to share this information with the public," said Coppola. "With access to this type of data, players can gain a real edge in the game and come out ahead."

Coppola has been playing blackjack since he was a teenager and has been teaching classes on the game for over 25 years. He is considered one of the foremost authorities on blackjack strategy and is well known for his innovative approaches to the game.

#  Francis Ford Coppola Shares Secret Of Successful Dealer's Mathematics In Calculating Blackjack Commissions

In a recent interview Francis Ford Coppola, Academy Award-winning film director and producer, spilled the beans on a secret of successful casino dealers. That secret is their mathematics in calculating blackjack commissions.

According to Coppola, "Casino dealers have to be good with numbers. They need to be able to calculate the commission percentage they're going to get on different hands, and do it quickly so they can keep up with the action." This is a skill that many dealers acquire through years of experience.

But what exactly is commission? Commission is the amount of money a dealer gets for every winning hand they dealt. It's calculated as a percentage of the total bet amount, and typically ranges from 5% to 10%. So, if you were playing at a table where the dealer was getting 10% commission, and you won a hand worth $100, the dealer would earn $10 for that hand.

Knowing how to calculate commissions quickly is essential for dealers, as it allows them to keep track of all the bets being placed at the table and make sure they're getting their proper cut. In fact, if dealers don't calculate commissions correctly, it can lead to major headaches for them (and for the casino). This is why many casinos now use gaming software that does all the commission calculations for them.

So if you're ever lucky enough to visit a casino and have a chance to watch the dealers in action, be sure to keep an eye on how quickly they're doing those mental math calculations! You may just learn something valuable.
