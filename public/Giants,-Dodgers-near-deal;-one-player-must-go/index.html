        <h1 id="Giants-Dodgers-near-deal-one-player-must-go"><a href="#Giants-Dodgers-near-deal-one-player-must-go" class="headerlink" title="Giants, Dodgers near deal; one player must go"></a>Giants, Dodgers near deal; one player must go</h1><p>The San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers are close to completing a blockbuster deal that would send one player from each team to the other, according to multiple reports.</p>
<p>The Giants would reportedly receive outfielder Yasiel Puig, second baseman Jose Peraza and pitcher Alex Wood, while the Dodgers would acquire first baseman Brandon Belt, catcher Buster Posey and outfielder Hunter Pence.</p>
<p>One player must go from each team in order for the trade to be completed, with third baseman Pablo Sandoval and starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw believed to be the most likely candidates.</p>
<p>Peraza is the only player in the trade who is not currently on an MLB roster. The 21-year-old batted .278&#x2F;.317&#x2F;.405 with six homers and 27 stolen bases between Double-A and Triple-A last season.</p>
<p>Wood, 25, was 6-6 with a 3.73 ERA in 23 games (22 starts) for the Dodgers last season. He has a career record of 39-32 with a 3.36 ERA in 99 games (98 starts) over five seasons with Atlanta and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Puig, 24, hit .263&#x2F;.321&#x2F;.436 with 11 homers and 38 RBIs in 104 games last season. He has hit .290&#x2F;.382&#x2F;.500 with 39 homers and 152 RBIs in three seasons since making his big league debut in 2013.</p>
<p>Belt, 28, batted .275&#x2F;.356&#x2F;.479 with 18 homers and 68 RBIs in 147 games last season. He has hit .273&#x2F;.350&#x2F;.468 with 93 homers and 372 RBIs over six seasons with San Francisco.</p>
<p>Posey, 30, batted .288&#x2F;.361&#x2F;.498 with 22 homers and 95 RBIs in 148 games last season. He has hit .306&#x2F;.375&#x2F;.494 with 152 homers and 572 RBIs over eight seasons with San Francisco.</p>
<p>Pence, 33, batted .253&#x2F;.320&#x2F;.429 with 13 homers and 59 RBIs in 130 games last season. He has hit .280&#x2F;.351&#x2F;.469 with 219 homers and 797 RBIs over 12 seasons split between Houston, Philadelphia and San Francisco.</p>
<h1 id="Diamondbacks’-deal-leaves-them-with-surplus-of-outfielders"><a href="#Diamondbacks’-deal-leaves-them-with-surplus-of-outfielders" class="headerlink" title="Diamondbacks’ deal leaves them with surplus of outfielders"></a>Diamondbacks’ deal leaves them with surplus of outfielders</h1><p>It appeared as if the Arizona Diamondbacks were going to have to trade one of their outfielders this offseason. The team has three quality players at the position in A.J. Pollock, David Peralta, and Steven Souza Jr. However, with the signing of outfielder Yasmany Tomas to a new contract on Monday, the Diamondbacks now find themselves with a surplus of outfielders.</p>
<p>The move leaves the Diamondbacks with $59 million committed to their 2019 payroll,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> which is currently the sixth-lowest total in baseball. It’s also worth noting that only two players on the roster are signed beyond 2019: first baseman Paul Goldschmidt and shortstop Nick Ahmed.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it would not be surprising to see the Diamondbacks make another move or two before Opening Day. They could look to trade either Pollock or Peralta in order to get some starting pitching help.</p>
<p>Pollock is coming off a 2018 season in which he hit .257 with 21 home runs and 65 RBIs. He is set to make $11 million in 2019 and 2020 and then become a free agent. Peralta had a breakout season in 2018, hitting .293 with 30 home runs and 87 RBIs. He is arbitration-eligible for the first time this offseason and is projected to make around $6 million next season.</p>
<p>Souza Jr., who was acquired from Tampa Bay at last year’s trade deadline, is also under contract for next season. He is set to make $4 million after putting up solid numbers following the trade (.255 average, 15 homers, 40 RBIs).</p>
<p>Tomas’ new deal is for four years and $60 million and includes an opt-out clause after the 2019 season. The 27-year-old hit .282 with 18 home runs and 82 RBIs last year while splitting time between left field and third base. With Jake Lamb penciled in at third base, Tomas will likely see most of his time in left field next season.</p>
<p>The signing of Tomas gives manager Torey Lovullo plenty of options when it comes to constructing his lineup next year. He could put Tomas in left field next to Pollock in center field or have Peralta play right field and Souza Jr. DH.</p>
<h1 id="Padres-dealing-away-lineup-players-in-preparation-for-rebuilding"><a href="#Padres-dealing-away-lineup-players-in-preparation-for-rebuilding" class="headerlink" title="Padres dealing away lineup players in preparation for rebuilding"></a>Padres dealing away lineup players in preparation for rebuilding</h1><p>The San Diego Padres have begun to trade away their major league players in preparation for a rebuild. The most recent trade saw them send first baseman Wil Myers to the Tampa Bay Rays in a three-team deal also involving the Cleveland Indians.</p>
<p>Myers was the organization’s biggest name, and his departure signals that the Padres are ready to tear down their roster and start from scratch. This may be unpopular with fans, but it’s the right move for the long-term success of the team.</p>
<p>When you’re rebuilding, you need young talent to build around. The Padres now have plenty of that, thanks to their recent flurry of trades. They’ve acquired some top prospects, including shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. and outfielder Luis Campusano.</p>
<p>These young players will have time to develop in the minor leagues, and they could eventually form the nucleus of a championship-caliber team. In the meantime, Padres fans can enjoy watching some exciting prospects play at Petco Park.</p>
<p>The rebuilding process won’t be easy, but it’s worth it in the end. I’m confident that the Padres will be back on top once they’ve completed their overhaul.</p>
<h1 id="Rockies-unloading-veteran-players-in-advance-of-youth-movement"><a href="#Rockies-unloading-veteran-players-in-advance-of-youth-movement" class="headerlink" title="Rockies unloading veteran players in advance of youth movement"></a>Rockies unloading veteran players in advance of youth movement</h1><p>The Colorado Rockies are in the midst of a youth movement, and that means veterans are on the trade block. Manager Bud Black recently confirmed that the team is willing to listen to offers for players such as Carlos Gonzalez, Charlie Blackmon, and Ian Desmond.</p>
<p>Blackmon is the most likely player to be traded, as he is a free agent at the end of the year. Gonzalez and Desmond have team-friendly contracts that could make them more difficult to move.</p>
<p>The Rockies are in last place in the NL West, so they are clearly looking to the future. The young players on their roster have shown promise, and the team is hoping to build around them.</p>
<p>Players like Nolan Arenado, Trevor Story, and German Marquez are all key pieces of the Rockies’ future. Trading away some of their veteran players will allow them to bring up some of their top prospects and give them playing time.</p>
<p>The Cardinals are reportedly interested in Gonzalez, while the Braves could be a potential fit for Desmond. There should be plenty of other interested teams, as well, given the talent that these players still have.</p>
<p>The Rockies are in a good position to rebuild their team through trades. They have some talented young players who can step up and take over for the veterans who are traded away. And with Bud Black at the helm, they should be in good hands for the future.</p>
<h1 id="Mariners-still-in-the-market-for-starting-pitcher"><a href="#Mariners-still-in-the-market-for-starting-pitcher" class="headerlink" title="Mariners still in the market for starting pitcher"></a>Mariners still in the market for starting pitcher</h1><p>The Mariners are still in the market for a starting pitcher after acquiring Mike Leake from the Cardinals on Wednesday. Leake is scheduled to start on Sunday against the Astros, but Drew Smyly (elbow) is not expected to return until after the All-Star break and James Paxton (pectoral) is not expected to return until late July.</p>
<p>Sources say the Mariners are interested in Blue Jays right-hander Aaron Sanchez, who was recently moved to the bullpen. The Blue Jays are said to be interested in prospects Mitch Haniger and Ryan Yarbrough from the Mariners. Other pitchers that have been mentioned as potential trade targets for the Mariners include Rays left-hander Blake Snell and Twins right-hander Ervin Santana.</p>
<p>The Mariners have also been linked to free agent pitchers Yu Darvish and Alex Cobb, but it’s unclear if they will be able to afford either of them. Darvish is reportedly seeking a six-year contract worth $160 million, while Cobb is said to be looking for a five-year deal worth around $100 million.</p>
